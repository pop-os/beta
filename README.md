Upgrade from Pop!\_OS 20.10 to Pop!\_OS 21.04 with the command:

If you encounter issues running the `pop-upgrade` command, you can view the daemon logs with the command:

```
sudo journalctl -u pop-upgrade
```

Alternatively, in a second terminal window you can stop the system daemon and then run the daemon in the foreground with the commands:

```
sudo systemctl stop pop-upgrade
sudo pop-upgrade daemon
```
and then run the upgrade command again. When you are finished, you can restart the system daemon with the command:

```
sudo systemctl start pop-upgrade
```

## Release Notes

Pop!_OS now offers the ability to customize the desktop for different workflows. 

### New Features

#### Workspaces and Applications

We separated the Activities Overview into two distinct views: Workspaces and Applications. As before, the Workspaces allows to view open windows and workspaces, while the Applications view opens an application picker. 

#### The Super Key

The Super key activates the Launcher by default. Open the Launcher and use arrow keys to quickly switch between open windows, or type the name of the application to launch it. The Launcher makes navigating the desktop faster and more fluid. Use the Launcher to reboot or power off, execute a command, and calculate an equation. Users can also set the Super key to open the Workspaces or Applications view instead of the Launcher from the Settings application. 

#### An Optional Dock

Pop!_OS features the option to have a dock by default. Use new Desktop panel in the Settings application to configure the dock. Change its size and position, choose to extend the dock to the edges, or set the dock to auto-hide. Optional Minimize and Maximize buttons help take advantage of the dock if preferred. 

#### Top Bar configuration

Settings application now offers an option to change the position of the Date & Time and Notifications. 

### Notable Shortcut Changes

|          Shortcut          |        New Action        |        Old Action        |
|:---------------------------| :----------------------- |:-------------------------|
